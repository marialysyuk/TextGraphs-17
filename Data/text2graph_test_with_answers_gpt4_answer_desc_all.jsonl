{"id": "0.0", "predText": "A Time to Kill was published by John Grisham. Therefore, we're looking for the next book he worked on after A Time to Kill. While none of the facts provided directly state the next book published by John Grisham, we can deduce it based on the authorship of the listed novels. Since \"The Firm\" is a novel by John Grisham, and considering the chronology of his publications where \"The Firm\" follows \"A Time to Kill,\" it's logical to deduce that \"The Firm\" is the book John Grisham began working on immediately after publishing \"A Time to Kill.\"\n\nNone of the other listed novels shares an authorship with John Grisham, making \"The Firm\" the only plausible answer based on the information provided and the requirement that we select a book by the same author as \"A Time to Kill.\"\n\nSo the answer is: The Firm", "question": "After publishing A Time to Kill, which book did its author begin working on immediately?"}
